### DESIGN

• Design for Manufacturability (DFM) - Ensuring that the product can be manufactured efficiently and effectively.

• Design for Assembly (DFA) - Simplifying the assembly process to increase efficiency and reduce errors.

• Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) - Utilizing Six Sigma methodologies in the product design process to minimize defects.

• Concurrent Engineering - Integrating the design, development, and production processes to improve quality and reduce lead times.

• Total Quality Management (TQM) - Ensuring that quality is built into the design of the product from the beginning.

• Value Engineering - Identifying and reducing unnecessary costs in the design process without sacrificing quality or function.

• Kansei Engineering - Designing products to elicit emotional responses from customers.

• Human-Centered Design - Focusing on the needs and experiences of the end user throughout the design process.

• Design Thinking - A creative problem-solving approach that emphasizes empathy, experimentation, and iteration.

• Lean Design - Applying the principles of Lean Manufacturing to the design process to reduce waste and increase efficiency.

Here are 7 methods that I recommend:
1. Value Engineering - This method involves analyzing a product or service to identify any inefficiencies or areas of improvement that can lead to cost reduction, quality improvement, or increased customer satisfaction.
2. 6 Thinking Hats - This is a creative problem-solving technique that involves looking at a problem from different perspectives, each represented by a different color "hat". This helps to explore all possible alternatives and make better decisions.
3. TRIZ - This is a systematic approach to problem-solving that helps to generate innovative solutions by applying scientific methods and analyzing past experiences.
4. Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) - This is a method used to identify potential failures in a product or process, assess their severity, and determine the best way to prevent or mitigate them.
5. Quality Function Deployment (QFD) - This method is used to translate customer needs into a product or service design, and involves identifying the key features that are required to meet customer expectations.
6. Design of Experiments (DOE) - This is a statistical method used to identify the optimal combination of input variables that will lead to the desired output.
7. Rapid Prototyping - This method involves creating a series of prototypes quickly and efficiently to test and refine a product or service design.

### RESEARCH

1. Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle: This is a scientific method used to help businesses improve their processes. It involves planning a change, implementing that change on a small scale, studying the results, and then acting on what you've learned.
2. Lean Manufacturing: This is a systematic approach to identifying and eliminating waste in a manufacturing process. It involves identifying the value-added steps in a process and removing any non-value added steps.
3. Design of Experiments (DOE): This is a statistical method that helps you determine which variables in a process have the biggest impact on the outcome. By testing different combinations of variables, you can identify the ideal process parameters that will produce the desired outcome.
4. Root Cause Analysis (RCA): This is a method used to identify the underlying cause of a problem. It involves asking "why?" multiple times to get to the root of the issue.
5. Gemba Walks: This is a technique that involves going to where the work is being done, observing the process, and talking to the people doing the work. It helps you identify areas for improvement and gather feedback from the employees who are closest to the process.
6. Value Stream Mapping: This is a visual tool used to analyze the flow of materials and information through a process. It helps you identify waste and areas for improvement.
7. Benchmarking: This involves comparing your processes to those of other companies that are considered best-in-class. It helps you identify areas where you can improve and learn from others.
8. Brainstorming: This is a creativity technique used to generate ideas. It involves gathering a group of people and encouraging them to come up with as many ideas as possible.
9. SWOT Analysis: This is a tool used to analyze the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of a business. It helps you identify areas where you can improve and areas where you need to be careful.
10. Customer Surveys: This involves gathering feedback from customers about their experience with your product or service. It helps you identify areas where you can improve and shows you where you're doing well.
