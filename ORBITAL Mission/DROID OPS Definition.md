DESIGN
• Design for Manufacturability (DFM) - Ensuring that the product can be manufactured efficiently and effectively.
• Design for Assembly (DFA) - Simplifying the assembly process to increase efficiency and reduce errors.
• Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) - Utilizing Six Sigma methodologies in the product design process to minimize defects.
• Concurrent Engineering - Integrating the design, development, and production processes to improve quality and reduce lead times.
• Total Quality Management (TQM) - Ensuring that quality is built into the design of the product from the beginning.
• Value Engineering - Identifying and reducing unnecessary costs in the design process without sacrificing quality or function.
• Kansei Engineering - Designing products to elicit emotional responses from customers.
• Human-Centered Design - Focusing on the needs and experiences of the end user throughout the design process.
• Design Thinking - A creative problem-solving approach that emphasizes empathy, experimentation, and iteration.
• Lean Design - Applying the principles of Lean Manufacturing to the design process to reduce waste and increase efficiency.

Here are 7 methods that I recommend:
1. Value Engineering - This method involves analyzing a product or service to identify any inefficiencies or areas of improvement that can lead to cost reduction, quality improvement, or increased customer satisfaction.
2. 6 Thinking Hats - This is a creative problem-solving technique that involves looking at a problem from different perspectives, each represented by a different color "hat". This helps to explore all possible alternatives and make better decisions.
3. TRIZ - This is a systematic approach to problem-solving that helps to generate innovative solutions by applying scientific methods and analyzing past experiences.
4. Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) - This is a method used to identify potential failures in a product or process, assess their severity, and determine the best way to prevent or mitigate them.
5. Quality Function Deployment (QFD) - This method is used to translate customer needs into a product or service design, and involves identifying the key features that are required to meet customer expectations.
6. Design of Experiments (DOE) - This is a statistical method used to identify the optimal combination of input variables that will lead to the desired output.
7. Rapid Prototyping - This method involves creating a series of prototypes quickly and efficiently to test and refine a product or service design.
